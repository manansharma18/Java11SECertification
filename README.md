# Java11SECertification

I created this repository while I was preparing for Oracle Certified Professional 11(1Z0-815). I decided to make this public after I cleared the exam. Please feel free to fork this out and play with this. Few highlights for the exam were:-

1. Know the principle of work and the return value of new Arrays.mismatch and Arrays.compare methods.
2. Know that List.of() method returns immutable List and throws UnsupportedOperationException in runtime if you try to change it.
3.“var” Type Name.
